This system serves as a way to assign emotional ratings to conversations using various LLM models. The project is built entirely using Python 3 and was run in an x86-64 Linux development environment. The project should run locally cross platform. To develop locally, make sure to catch up on the dependencies:

```bash
# install dependencies from requirements.txt

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The project makes use of a `.env` file to set environment variables, including the sensitive OpenAI api key. The following are the available options for the `.env` file. The `API_KEY` is the only field that must be set, all other fields will be set to the shown values by default.

```bash
API_KEY        = <API_KEY>
```
